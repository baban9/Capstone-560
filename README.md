# Capstone-560

# Method of Execution 
- requirements.txt: all the necessary libraries (probably will be updated for deployment purpose)
- rename.py: for changing the names of the images as per "panoid_lat_lon" (haven't used that extensively for images)
- GPScoordinates: take in the GPS coordinates and gives out the CSV file with the desired incremental coordinates.
- Get_images: takes in the CSV and gives out the GSV images of that grid.
- FileMove: rather than manually trying to move files, we were trying to use python to do so.
- dataAnalysis: a naive approach to look at the data and details of the images.
- UPC classification v1.1 : For binary classification with and without UPC poles.
